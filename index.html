    <img src="fixnonet_design.png">
    <p>The fixnonet is a router that operates off the cellular network. It should run off batteries because the conditions that it might be in may not have a mains power supply. It is designed to help people who have a laptop but no internet access. It will be powered by a sim card module from Adafruit. </p>
